### Project title
Our tentative project title is, "Rats! Rodent Exposure Impacts on Asthma Prevalence in NYC"

### Motivation for project
NYC is infamous for the rodents that live among us. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862381/) shows that exposure to rodents is associated with a wide variety of disease and poor health outcomes, including asthma symptoms. This project is motivated by the following questions: What trends are there in rodent infestations throughout NYC? How does it vary by neighborhood? How are rodent trends associated with asthma trends? What are the potential confounding variables?

### Intended final products
* Website
  + Scope, questions, data
  + Tables  
  + Dashboard of some visualsâ€“graphs, maps
  + Summary of results
  + Full report
* Screencast video 
* Github repo

### The anticipated data sources
* Rodent data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj
* Asthma data - we need to further look at the data below to see what is the most useful for our purposes 
  + https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/health-topics/asthma-provider-data.page
  + https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/asthma_dashboard/ad_dashboard&p=it&ind_id=ad16
  + https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/data-explorer/asthma/?id=2383#display=summary
* BRFSS 
  + Report: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/reports/
  + Data: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/data.htm#annual

### Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges
* Planned analyses:
  + Asthma rates over time, by location
  + Levels of rodent infestation by location
    + Overlaid with asthma rates if possible
  + Interactive map showing rodent infestations by coordinate
* Anticipated Challenges:
  + Overlaying rodents and asthma data sets. For example, their coding of locations may not be the same

### The planned timeline
* November 12th to 18th: look more closely at the data sources and finalize which ones are best to work with for our purposes
* November 19th to 24th: clean all the data sources and start working on the analysis
* November 28th to December 2nd: finish any remaining analyses and start working on report + website
* December 2nd to December 9th: finish working on report + website
